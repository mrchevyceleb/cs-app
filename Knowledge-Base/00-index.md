### Tier 1: Self-Service / AI Agent Resolution
- Consult this knowledge base
- Walk customer through documented troubleshooting steps
- Verify plan eligibility for requested features

### Tier 2: Escalate to Human Support Agent
Escalate when:
- Customer reports a bug not documented in troubleshooting
- Customer requests a refund or billing dispute
- Customer reports data loss or security concern
- Issue persists after all documented troubleshooting steps are exhausted
- Customer explicitly requests human support

### Tier 3: Escalate to Engineering
Escalate when:
- Reproducible platform-wide outage
- Authentication system failure affecting multiple users
- Streaming infrastructure issues (RTMP endpoints unresponsive)

### Escalation Information to Collect
Before escalating, always collect:
1. Customer email and account ID
2. Current plan (Basic or Business)
3. Browser and OS version
4. Steps to reproduce the issue
5. Error messages (exact text, error codes)
